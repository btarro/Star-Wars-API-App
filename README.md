## Summary

WIP

<!-- This app was written leveraging React & Bootstrap. The focus of this project was to build an expense tracker that improved upon the earlier vanilla JavaScript version availble [here](https://github.com/btarro/expense-tracker-app)

Features:

- Responsive Design
- Add / Remove expenses
- Capture: Description, Location, Date, and Amount

In the future versions I'd like to:

- add balance
- Store expenses beyond the current session
- add sorting -->
